			<div class = "cage-content1">You want to find the perfect cage for your furry friend, but how do you know which cage will suit your hamster best? A cage not only offers your hamster a place to rest and play  but somewhere they can feel safe and protected.</div>
			<div class = "cage-content1">There are so many different types of hamster cages on the market. From wire cages to modular habitats, glass tanks and plastic DIY bins, finding your hamster a forever home can be stressful. Here I explain the pros and cons of  the best types of hamster cage.</div>
		</div>
		<div class = "cage-content2">Ideally, you want to ensure that the cage you select is right for them today, tomorrow and for the next few years, and you don’t want the upheaval of settling them into a new environment each time they outgrow their current dwellings. For this reason, I would  recommend getting the largest cage feasible for your circumstances, to give your hamster plenty of space to grow, explore and burrow.</div>

			What to consider
			</div>
			<div class = "cage2-title2">
			when choosing a hamster cage
			</div>
			<div class = "cage2-subtitle">
			Before you go out and select a hamster cage there are a number of factors that you should consider first. Such as: 
			</div>
			<div class = "cage2-content">
			What breed of hamster do you want to get? This will help determine the size of the cage you will eventually need. Dwarf hamsters, although smaller, enjoy the company of others so may still require a larger cage even if they are dinky in size.	
			</div>
			<div class = "cage2-content">
			Are you (or your children) likely to find cleaning out your hamster a chore? Just like washing, hoovering etc, cleaning out your hamster is often low down the list of priorities. But regular cage cleaning is essential for a healthy hamster, so the easier you can make it, the easier it is to convince your children to help (in theory – I have yet to see this work in practice)!
			</div>
			<div class = "cage2-content">
			How much space do you have to store a hamsters cage? This will affect not only the size but the design of the cage. There are so many clever designs on the market these days from stackable cages to some that sit side by side and even ones you can DIY and make to measure.
			</div>
			<div class = "cage2-content">
			Who will be accessing the cage? If you have young children, you need to ensure that they don’t spend their entire time poking their fingers through the cage whilst still having easy access to be able to get your hamster out for a play.
			</div>
			<div class = "cage2-content">
			Consider ventilation. Plastic tubes and tunnels can be fun for your hamster to play in but do trap air and moisture making it difficult for them to breathe. We personally found that our hamster enjoyed sleeping in the small plastic tubes which not only creating a lot of mess but causing him to develop pink eye.
			</div>
			<div class = "cage2-content">
			Make sure that the cage is safe. Consider the materials that your cage is made from. Hamsters are great gnawers so can easily chew through thin plastic so make sure they are tough yet non-toxic. And, if you have wires, watch out for the spacing as you don’t want you dwarf hamsters escaping.
