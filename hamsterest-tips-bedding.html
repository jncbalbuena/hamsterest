			<div class = "bedding-content1">Hamsters like to build nests. It is their safe haven where they can curl up and sleep. Their nests are there to keep them warm, offer a familiar scent and is the perfect place to bury their hoards.</div>
			<div class = "bedding-content1">In the wild, a hamster would look to build their nest out of natural resources. For example, a Syrian hamster (which originates from the desert), would seek solace from the sun and predators by digging and creating a nest underground. Here they are well cossetted and are able to keep cool.</div>
			<div class = "bedding-content1">Campbell Russian hamsters, however, live out their days on dry verdant plains, so use grass and sheep’s wool to make their nests.</div>
			<div class = "bedding-content1">It is important that as responsible hamster owners we consider the needs of our pets and try and replicate their natural environment as much as possible.</div>

			Within your hamster’s cage you will find two different types of bedding. There is the substrate which lines the base of the cage, and the nesting material with which they can use to create a comfortable bed.

				Here we look at the best materials to use for your hamster’s nest bedding.
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding2-boldContent">
				ASPEN SHAVINGS
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding2-content">
				Aspen shavings are safe enough to use for hamster bedding. Although this option is cost-effective and natural-looking, it is not particularly comfortable for your hamster. Aspen shavings tend to also be less absorbent than other materials, so odor may become an issue.
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding2-boldContent">
				PLANT-BASED PAPER FIBERS
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding2-content">
				Plant-based paper fibres are highly absorbent so are great at efficiently controlling odors. They are soft and squidgy, and some brands even offer a 99% dust-free option, which is great for your hamster’s health
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding2-boldContent">
				PELLETED WOOD AND PAPER
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding2-content">
				Wood and recycled newspaper pellets offer good bedding materials since they don’t scatter and make a mess. They are also more absorbent than normal wood-based shavings. For long-haired hamster owners, pellets are also good as you do not need to worry about their hair getting tangled.
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding2-boldContent">
				SHREDDED PAPER
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding2-content">
				Shredded paper is one of the most common types of hamster bedding materials. This paper-based material consists of long narrow stripes of confetti and can often come in a range of vibrant colors.

			WHAT IS

			<div class = "bedding3-title2">
			SUBSTRATE?
			</div>
			<div class = "bedding-small-texts2">
				<div class = "bedding-small-content">Substrate is the technical term for the material used to line the bottom of your hamsters cage. It should be used in addition to your hamster’s bedding, which they also require in order to nest.
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding-small-content">A good substrate should be absorbent so that it soaks up your hamster’s excrement, soft enough for them to walk on without causing injury and able to disguise a multitude of smells.Substrate is readily available to buy as wood chippings or sawdust. You must make sure that the material you choose:

				</div>
				<div class = "bedding-small-content">Is dust-free to prevent any breathing problems. Has not been chemically treatedIt should not matter which breed of hamster you own, whether you have a Syrian on a Dwarf, they all need a dust-free environment and a super soft, absorbent substrate to run around on.

			SAFE FOR HAMSTER?
			</div>
			<div class = "bedding-small-texts3">
				<div class = "bedding-small-content1">Sawdust is often used; however, it can irritate some hamsters eyes, nose and lungs and cause skin allergies.
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding-small-content1">Compressed paper bedding is a good choice if your hamsters is sensitive as it is softer, less harsh on small body parts and absorbs urine well.
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding-small-content1">That said, we have always used a particular brand of sawdust for our hamster and never had a problem. If you do change your substrate, I would recommend monitoring your hamster closely to check that they remain safe and healthy.
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding-small-content1">Always make sure that your sawdust is at least 3” deep so that your hamster has plenty to cushion them as they walk around, and that it is thick enough absorb any wee. If your hamster likes to burrow, then add a couple of extra inches for them to tunnel and play.

			<div class = "bedding-small-texts4">
				<div class = "bedding-small-content2">
				Wood pulp bedding is a good alternative for those seeking something other than sawdust. It is a safe and healthy option as it is made from reclaimed pulp waste, so is free from inks, dyes, clay and harmful toxins
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding-small-content2">Some, such as the Carefresh brand, sanitize their bedding to 380 degrees to ensure that any bacteria, mold or fungus has been killed off before bagging.
				</div>
				<div class = "bedding-small-content2">Recycled paper is a great choice to line a hamster’s cage as it can absorb twice the amount of liquid than wood shavings or sawdust can, and helps to keep your hamster’s habitat fresher for longer.

					There are lots of different substrates available, that often finding the right one for your hamster can be overwhelming. But as long as you pick a brand that is safe (no Cedar or Pine), contains little dust and is softs on their paws, then your hamster will soon make themselves at home.<br>
					<div class = "ending-tip2">
					Just remember to combine the substrate with a good handful of nesting material, so that your hamster can create a comfortable bed.

					<div class = "ending-tip3">
					If you have a large cage, then you may want to consider a variety of substrates to encourage your hamster to use the different areas of their habitat. This could include a sand bath, burrowing area and den.
