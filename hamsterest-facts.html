					Roborovski dwarf hamsters are the smallest dwarf hamsters - but they’re also the fastest! They are very curious and active, and spend all day running and flitting about their cages. These little rodents run so far in one night that it would be like a human running four marathons. That’s 4 x 26.21 miles (42.195 km) = 104.87 miles (168.78 km). Roborovski dwarf hamsters also have a nickname - “Robos”. It’s a little easier to say after all! Although these little pets are incredibly cute, they don’t like being petted. Their characters are shy and reserved, and not very tame. Hamster fans respect this and simply love watching their little friends go about their business.

					The teddy hamster’s special feature is its lovely, soft, fluffy long fur. It grows to 2.4 inch (6 cm) long or even longer! As soon as you see such a cute little hamster, you just MELT. Teddy hamsters are a breed of Syrian hamster. They do not exist in the wild. They are sometimes called Angora hamsters. The dense fur is all the same length on male animals but just long on the back and rear of females (but they still look beautifully fluffy). Teddy hamsters are also lovingly referred to as teddy bear hamsters.

					The highlight of the Campbell dwarf hamster is the dark brown to black dorsal stripe on its back and its special character! Hamsters’ personalities don’t vary that much, especially when compared to dogs and cats. Apart from this particular hamster. There are some very tame and friendly animals, but the Campbell dwarf hamster is mostly known as stubborn and almost even grumpy. It may nip to express how much it doesn’t like something. Hopefully it won’t have too much to be unhappy about.<br><br>Nevertheless, this is definitely not the best "beginner” hamster. They’re better suited to experienced hamster owners.
